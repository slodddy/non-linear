Dear admission committee,

Here is my admission to the NLN home assignment. I programmed everything in glitch, as I haven't programmed in years and I did need direct feedback. It's a bit messy as I was learning on my way. I hope works on other screen resolutions as well as on my own, but I am afraid not (things I discovered in a later stage when half the code was done.) 

Looking forward to meet you all wednesday! 

Kind regards, 
Lotte Verkaik
