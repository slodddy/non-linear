<i>I am lying down on my belly, looking through the deep green <br>
blades of grass. The weather is cooling down, but it has been<br>
a hot day. I feel the first cold breeze blowing over my freshly <br>
sunburned legs. It tickles; just like the ant walking over my <br>
left forearm. My father enters the garden with a big <br>
bowl of cherries. He shows me how you pull the stem off while <br>
   you keep the fruit in your mouth, and how you have to spit <br>
out the pit. I try it and spit out the pit in my hand. There is still<br> 
a lot of pulp around the pit and it’s very slippery. It looks <br> beautiful; out of this world. A little planet where I would like to live.

   Cherries used to be a delight I shared with my father. It is one <br> of my most vivid memories from when I 
   was younger. <br> Maybe it’s because of the full tactile experience that cherries <br> evoke… <br> <br> I haven’t 
   been craving to eat cherries since I moved <br> out. The experience of eating a cherry has been replaced by <br> the 
   hyperreal equivalent of the fruit: 
   &#127826. A symbol that <br> represents both the male and female genitalia, sexuality and <br> the loss of innocence. 
   The emoji keeps popping up. <a href="https://valuable-fork-polo.glitch.me/playlist.html"> Some of <br> my favorite songs share a title with “cherry” in it. </a>Is the tactile <br> experience 
   I know reduced to a memory? Is my innocence <br>lost? <b>How does one restore a relationship with a cherry? </b></p>
